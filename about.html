            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>From a young age, my heart was captivated by the magic of cinematography. After 10th, I started
                creating videos and sharing them on YouTube, hoping to turn my passion into a career. Despite my
                efforts, success in the realm of filmmaking remained elusive.

                Determined to find a new path, I tackled the PPT exam and secured a spot at SVPC, Bhopal, one of the
                top government diploma colleges in Madhya Pradesh. I pursued a diploma in mechanical engineering and
                excelled, earning placements in three companies. However, the mechanical engineering field didn't
                ignite my passion, and I found myself yearning for something different.

                My interests began to shift towards the IT sector, and I decided to pursue a B.Tech in computer
                science. During my studies, I delved into frontend development, mastering React.js, JavaScript,
                HTML, and CSS. After much dedication and hard work, I proudly built my first portfolio.

                The transition from filmmaking to mechanical engineering and finally to software engineering was far
                from easy. It was a journey filled with challenges and self-discovery. Along the way, I had the
                incredible opportunity to intern at IBM through a virtual internship, where my team worked on a
                sustainable development project.

                This winding path taught me resilience and the importance of following one's passion, no matter how
                many twists and turns it may take.
